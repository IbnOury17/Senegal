        <!-- Overview -->
        <h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This portfolio website was designed as an engineering project, not a simple
              personal website. Instead of focusing on visual trends or buzzwords, the goal
              was to build a system that communicates real engineering work clearly,
              honestly, and efficiently.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Every section is structured to explain not just <em>what</em> was built,
              but <em>why</em> it was built that way, what constraints existed, and what
              was learned in the process.
            </p>

        <h3 class="major">Design Origin & Intent</h3>
            <p>
              This website did not start with code. It started as a long design problem.
              For nearly six months, the structure, layout, and purpose of the site were
              refined mentally before a single line of HTML was written.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The guiding question was simple but demanding:
              <em>How do you present engineering work in a way that is honest, readable,
              and respectful of the reviewer’s time?</em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Every section, interaction, and visual decision exists to support that goal —
              not aesthetics for their own sake.
            </p>

            <p>
              When viewed through an engineering lens, the portfolio functions as a
              structured information system optimized for fast comprehension and
              accurate evaluation.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>System Objective:</strong> Communicate real engineering capability without exaggeration</li>
              <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Recruiters, engineers, project reviewers</li>
              <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Clear understanding of skills, decisions, and constraints</li>
              <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Attention span, technical skepticism, time pressure</li>
              <li><strong>Design Strategy:</strong> Minimalism, hierarchy, behavior-first explanations</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        </div>

        <!-- Design Philosophy -->
       <h3 class="major">Design Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                  Many portfolios try to impress through visuals or marketing language.
                  This one takes a different approach.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  The design prioritizes clarity over decoration, structure over flash,
                  and explanation over exaggeration. Each project is treated as a system,
                  and each system is explained through behavior, decisions, and trade-offs.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  If something worked, it is shown. If something failed or required iteration,
                  it is explained. That honesty is intentional.
                </p>

        <h3 class="major">System Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              The portfolio is structured as a modular information system.
              Each page serves a defined function and communicates a specific layer
              of technical depth.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Home:</strong> High-level signal and identity</li>
              <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Engineering decisions, behavior, and results</li>
              <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Context and technical trajectory</li>
              <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Real-world exposure and constraints</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              This separation prevents information overload while allowing deeper exploration
              when needed.
            </p>


        <!-- Key Features -->
      <h3 class="major">Key Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Project pages written like simplified engineering reports</li>
            <li>Clear behavior-based explanations instead of vague summaries</li>
            <li>Consistent layout to reduce cognitive load while reading</li>
            <li>Optional technical depth for engineers who want more detail</li>
          </ul>


        <!-- Why It Matters -->
          <h3 class="major">Why This Project Matters</h3>
              <p>
                Strong engineering work can lose its value if it is poorly communicated.
                This project treats communication itself as an engineering problem.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                By applying structure, constraints, and iteration to how projects are presented,
                the website becomes an extension of the engineering work rather than just a container for it.
              </p>
     


     <h3 class="major">Engineering Constraints & Trade-offs</h3>
          <p>
            Like any engineered system, this website was designed under real constraints.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Recruiters may spend less than two minutes on a portfolio</li>
            <li>Engineers are skeptical of vague claims</li>
            <li>Visual noise reduces technical credibility</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            The design intentionally sacrifices animation-heavy visuals and
            marketing language in favor of clarity, structure, and traceable logic.
          </p>


  <h3 class="major">Engineering Growth Path</h3>
          <p>
            This website represents a shift in how I approach engineering work.
            Earlier projects focused on building systems that function.
            This project focuses on building systems that communicate.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The same principles used in my robotics projects — modularity,
            constraints, behavior-first design, and iterative refinement —
            are applied here at a higher level.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As my technical work grows in complexity, this platform is designed
            to evolve alongside it without losing clarity or honesty.
          </p>


  <h3 class="major">Engineering & Build Process</h3>
      <p>
        The development of this website followed an engineering-style workflow rather
        than a traditional web design approach. The process evolved through multiple
        stages, from conceptual sketching to final implementation.
      </p>
      
      
        <h4>Conceptual Design</h4>
      <p>
        For nearly six months, the structure and intent of the website were developed
        mentally before any coding began. During this phase, the focus was not on colors
        or animations, but on information flow and reader experience.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Questions considered during this phase included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does a recruiter need to understand first?</li>
        <li>How much technical depth is too much?</li>
        <li>How can complexity be revealed gradually?</li>
      </ul>
  
        <h4>Structural Planning</h4>
          <p>
            Before implementation, the site was broken down into functional pages,
            each serving a specific role within the overall system.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Landing pages provide high-level signal</li>
            <li>Project pages handle detailed explanations</li>
            <li>Navigation remains minimal to avoid distraction</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            This modular structure allows the website to scale without becoming cluttered.
          </p>


          <h4>Technology Stack</h4>
              <p>
                The website was intentionally built using lightweight and transparent tools
                to maintain full control over structure and behavior.
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>HTML5 for semantic structure</li>
                <li>CSS for layout and visual hierarchy</li>
                <li>Minimal JavaScript for interaction and behavior</li>
                <li>GitHub Pages for deployment and version control</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                Avoiding heavy frameworks ensured that design decisions remained intentional
                rather than dictated by tools.
              </p>

            <h4>Engineering Mode</h4>
                    <p>
                      Engineering Mode was introduced to serve technically inclined reviewers
                      without overwhelming general readers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      This optional layer allows engineers to analyze the website as a system,
                      while keeping the default experience simple and accessible.
                    </p>

  
                    <h4>Planned Evolution</h4>
                      <p>
                        This website is designed to evolve alongside future engineering work.
                        As projects increase in complexity, the structure allows for deeper
                        documentation without redesigning the system.
                      </p>
                      
                      <ul>
                        <li>Additional technical deep dives</li>
                        <li>More interactive system diagrams</li>
                        <li>Expanded project documentation</li>
