<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
<p>
Ashton the Turtleduck is a hands-on electromechanical project built to explore what really happens when electrical theory leaves 
	the classroom and meets the real world. The goal was simple on paper: use ionized water to complete an electrical circuit and power a motor. 
	In practice, it quickly became an exercise in mechanical design, electrical trade-offs, and experimental uncertainty.

This project combines conductivity, buoyancy, waterproofing, and energy conversion into a single system 
that had to physically work not just look correct in calculations.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
<p>
Design and build a floating electromechanical device that activates when placed in ionized water, 
demonstrating key engineering principles including resistance, current flow, buoyancy, and electrical-to-mechanical energy conversion.

Beyond making the system function, the objective was to measure performance, identify losses, 
and understand why real systems rarely behave like ideal models.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Mechanical & Electrical Design</h3>
<p>
The Turtleduck body was fully 3D printed and sealed to protect internal electronics from water exposure. 
Special care was taken with buoyancy and weight distribution to ensure the device floated level while still allowing the motor shaft to interact with the external load.

Early testing revealed severe corrosion issues when using copper electrodes, leading to unreliable electrical behavior.
To solve this, the electrodes were redesigned using aluminum, which significantly reduced oxidation and improved consistency during testing.

<h3 class="major">Circuit Logic & Theory</h3>
<p>
When salt is added to water, the resistance of the water decreases, allowing current to flow between the electrodes and complete the circuit.
Using Ohm’s Law (V = IR), this increase in current enables the motor to activate.

In this system, the water itself acts as a variable conductive path rather than an insulator. 
Small changes in salt concentration had noticeable effects on current flow and motor behavior, reinforcing the sensitivity of real electrical systems to environmental conditions.

<h3 class="major">Testing & Experimental Results</h3>
<p>
To evaluate system performance, efficiency testing was conducted using a hanging mass experiment. 
Electrical energy from the circuit was converted into mechanical motion, lifting a known mass over a measured distance.

By recording voltage, current, lifted mass, and time, the system’s electrical input power and mechanical output power were estimated. 
While the overall efficiency was low, the results clearly demonstrated where energy was being lost — primarily through friction, water resistance, and sealing constraints.
</p>

<div class="experiment-section">

  <h3 class="major">Experimental Energy Breakdown</h3>

  <p>
    The Turtleduck system converts electrical energy into mechanical motion through a conductive water path. 
	Measurements were taken at each stage to estimate how efficiently energy moved through the system, from electrical input to mechanical output.

Rather than focusing on ideal efficiency, this experiment emphasized understanding losses
and limitations, which are unavoidable in real-world engineering designs..

<h3 class="major">Engineering Challenges</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Achieving reliable waterproofing significantly increased mechanical complexity/li>
  <li>Friction and sealing methods reduced mechanical efficiency</li>
  <li>Electrical measurements varied due to changing water conductivity </li>
	<li>Repeating experiments consistently proved difficult </li>
  <li>A simple-looking system revealed strong interdisciplinary dependencies</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="major">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>
This project reinforced that engineering problems rarely belong to a single discipline. 
Electrical theory, mechanical constraints, materials science, and experimental uncertainty all interacted in ways that could not be ignored.

It was a strong reminder that real systems expose weaknesses in assumptions, and that 
troubleshooting often matters more than initial calculations.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, This project demonstrated that intelligent behavior does not require complex
algorithms. Well-structured priorities and clean behavior separation can produce
robust autonomy with minimal computation.
</p>



<h3 class="major">Future Improvements</h3>
<p>
Future iterations of the Turtleduck would include a modular battery system, improved sealing techniques, and more precise experimental measurement methods. 
Refining the mechanical transmission and reducing friction would also improve efficiency and repeatability.
